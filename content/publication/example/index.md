Summary: Growing up, I have always view the world as an intertwined place of unchaining realities. The human's minds are full of endless possibilities, especially children's. I have glanced through "Mua" when I was small, and for a long time, the poem has been a happy place for me to hide from stressful reality. Tran Dang khoa, as a child, had brought out the joyful, vivid side of an ordinary summer shower. I wanted to illustrate every nuance of Khoa's perspective, hoping the audience to experience a child's interpretation of the world as an escape from their busy, stressful lives

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The works from Illustration Stream of Design Studies program. Students were asked to illustrate a traditional story of their own choosing
